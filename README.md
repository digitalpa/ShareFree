# Share Free

Cookie free social sharing.
      
Social plugins usually contain tracking code that tracks all your visitors. If you respect the privacy of your clients, you should use this tracking free code. The additional benefit is you will have no trouble with the EU cookie law since this plugin uses no cookies.

You can improve the sharing using open graph meta tags in the header of your web page.
